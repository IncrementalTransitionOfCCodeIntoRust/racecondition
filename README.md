This C program was designed to produce a race condition for long strings that are printed character by character,
eventually fighting for the same pid_t.

Try it out by repeatedly executing the program, although for me it often produces the issue right away on the first try.

The author of this slightly modified program is Adithya B.
This is learning material used at the Course USP and CD Lab at the Jyothy Institue of Technology.
